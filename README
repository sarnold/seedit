2. How to build from tar ball.
See INSTALL file included in tar ball.


3. How to build rpm package.
For this purpose, buildpkg.sh is prepared.

You must customize following value in buildpkg.sh

VERSION=2.1.0
-> version

BETA=-beta5
-> when beta release beta number is here. Do not forget "-" 

DISTRO=fc6
-> DISTRO. fc6,fc5,cos4,f8 is supported.

RELEASE=1
-> This is not used..

PYTHON_VER=2.4
-> Version of python. Such as 2.4,2.3.
For FC5,FC6, it is 2.4.
For Cent OS 4, it is 2.3.

AUDITCONF=\\/etc\\/audit\\/audit.rules
-> Path to audit.rules file. "\\" is used for escape in shell script, do not forget.
For FC5,6: \\/etc\\/audit\\/audit.rules
For Cent OS 4: \\/etc\\/audit.rules

MODULAR=y
-> Whether modular policy is supported or not.
For FC5,6: y
For Cent OS 4: n

CUSTOMIZABLE_TYPES=y
-> Whether customizable_types file is supported or not
For FC5,6: y
For Cent OS 4: n

PAM_INCLUDE_SUPPORT=y
-> Whether "include" syntax for pam is supported.
For FC5,6: y
For Cent OS 4: n

SVNROOT=~/seedit/trunk/
