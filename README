See INSTALL file included in tar ball.


3. How to build rpm package.
For this purpose, buildpkg.sh is prepared.

You must customize following value in buildpkg.sh

VERSION=2.1.0
-> version

BETA=-beta5
-> when beta release beta number is here. Do not forget "-" 

DISTRO=fc6
-> DISTRO. fc6,fc5,cos4,f8 is supported.

RELEASE=1

For Cent OS 4, it is 2.3.

AUDITCONF=\\/etc\\/audit\\/audit.rules
-> Path to audit.rules file. "\\" is used for escape in shell script, do not forget.
For FC5,6: \\/etc\\/audit\\/audit.rules
For Cent OS 4: \\/etc\\/audit.rules

MODULAR=y
-> Whether modular policy is supported or not.
For FC5,6: y
For Cent OS 4: n

CUSTOMIZABLE_TYPES=y
