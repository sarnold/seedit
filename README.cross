You can develop policy for cross development.
This is useful to write policy for embedded devices.


0. Prepare SELinux environment in your target system.
 You need SELinux enabled kernel, libselinux, and SELinux commands.
 You can download libselinux from http://www.nsa.gov/selinux.
   To compile libselinux, you might have to set __thread as NULL like below.
   $ make ARCH=<your arch> CC=<your cross compiler> CFLAGS=-D__thread=
  
 You can install SELinux commands easily by using BusyBox.
 BusyBox 1.7.1 supports SELinux commands.
  Enable SELinux in build option and you have to enable load_policy and setfiles and getenforce, setenforce.
  

1. INSTALL
You have to download tar ball of seedit(after 2.2.0).

I assume you install seedit cross development kit under ~/seedit-cross.

$ cd core
$ make
$ make cross-install DESTDIR=~/seedit-cross
$ cd ..
$ cd policy
$ make cross-install DESTDIR=~/seedit-cross

2. What is installed
You will see following files and directories under ~/seedit-cross.

* audit2spdl
 This is audit2spdl, generate policy from log.
 

* dynamic_contexts  
 Here, files that are labeled by file type transision is registered.
 Usually, you do not edit this.

* seedit/            
 Python module for audit2spdl.

* seedit-cross.sh
 Script that converts SPDL to SELinux policy.

* base_policy/  and macros/
  Files used by seedit-converter to convert SPDL to SELinux policy.
* seedit-converter
  Program to convert SPDL, internally called from seedit-cross.sh.

* simplified_policy/
 Least set of polcy written in SPDL.

3. Writing policy
I assume you are in ~/seedit-converter.

1) Install minimum policy to target system.
 $ ./seedit-load -cd
 Then you will see policy_root dir.
 in policy_root, files that can be installed under /etc/selinux/seedit
 is generated.

 Copy these files and dirs under policy_root by ssh or NFS or something else.

2) Load and relabel in target system.
 In target system, you have to load policy and relabel.
 # load_policy
 # restorecon -R /
 
 Modify files under ./simplified_polcy.
 These files are  written by SPDL.
 For SPDL, see http://seedit.sourceforge.net/documentation.html
 
3) When you modify policy
 $ ./seedit-load -v
 will convert SPDL. Conveted policy is outputted in sepolicy/ dir.
 When you see it is OK to transfer policy to target machine,
 $ ./seedit-load -v -d
 policy is deployed to policy_root/ dir.
 You can copy it /etc/selinux/seedit in your target.

 In below, you  have to work on target.
 You will see useful file /etc/selinux/seedit/fcdiff.
 In fcdiff file, file names are listed. Files those labels may be changed are listed.
 You can reflect policy change by following commands.
 #load_policy
 # restorecon -f fcdiff -R -v
 
4) Supporting tools
   You can use audit2spdl tool.
   $./audit2spdl -i  <log file> -l 
   will analyze log file like audit2allow, and generate policy that you need.
   $./seedit-gui-generate-policy
   is GUI version of audit2spdl.
   You can create new domain  by GUI.
   $./seedit-gui-domain-manager
