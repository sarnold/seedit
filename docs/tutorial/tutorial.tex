This document is manual for SELinux Policy Editor.
You can learn by example what is SELinux Policy Editor, and How to use.\\
About how to install see Install Guide.

\section{What is SELinux Policy Editor}
SELinux is included in many distros, but it has been disabled by many users
because of they feel SELinux is too difficult. 
SELinux Policy Editor(seedit) is a tool that make SELinux easy.
seedit is composed of Simplified Policy and utilities that handle
Simplified Policy.The main component is Simplified Policy.
Simplified Policy is a SELinux policy that is described by Simplified
Policy Description Language(SPDL).SPDL resolves difficulty of SELinux. 
SPDL simplifies SELinux by reducing number of permissions and hiding
labels. 
Following is a example of policy described by SPDL.
\begin{verbatim}
{
domain httpd_t;
program /usr/sbin/httpd;
...
allow /var/www/** r,s;
allownet -protocol tcp -port 80 server;
...
}	
\end{verbatim}
You can easily understand what the policy says. Customize is also
easy, because of helper tools. 
It's original version was developed by Hitachi Software(http://www.selinux.hitachi-sk.co.jp/).
It has been re-designed and almost re-written by Yuichi
Nakamura(ynakam@gwu.edu) since version 1.0.


\section{Background of SELinux}
You have to be familiar with some SELinux background, especially
following.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item TE(Type-Enforcement)\\
       Access control model of SELinux is called TE. In TE, process is
       given {\it domain}. SELinux decides access control based on
       configuration file called {\it policy}. In policy , {\it What
       kind of resource a domain is allowed to access ?} is described.
       To identify resources, SELinux uses label called {\it type}, but
       you do not have to be worry about {\it type}, because it is hidden
       in seedit world.
       By giving proper domain to application and configuring domain
       properly, the application  have least privilege. 

 \item Enforcing/permissive mode\\
       SELinux have two mode, enforcing and permissive mode.
       Enforcing mode is normal mode. Access control is
       effective.        \\
       Permissive mode is a test mode. Even if there is a access that is
       denied by SELinux, it is not actually denied, but only written to
       log. In permissive mode, SELinux is effectively disabled, but
       useful to test the behavior of access control.
       To see current mode, you can use {\it getenforce} command. To
       switch between enforcing/permissive mode, you can use {\it
       setenforce} command. The usage will appear later in the document.
 \item SELinux access denial log\\
      Access denial is outputted in /var/log/messages in Fedora
       Core5. In Fedora Core4 or using auditd service, it is outputted
       to /var/log/audit/audit.log.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Overview of GUI}
You can manage SELinux from SELinux Policy Editor's GUI.
GUI is X Window based. 
In this tutorial, how to use GUI is shown first. You can also manage
from command line, it is shown later.\\
You can launch GUI from Gnome menu. Choose Application $\rightarrow$
System tools $\rightarrow$ SELinux
Policy Editor.
You can also launch  GUI, by typing seedit-gui.\\
You will see window {\it SELinux Policy Editor Control Panel}.
In the control panel, you will see icons(you will see buttons instead of
icons in Cent OS 4) like figure \ref{fig:controlpanel}.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{SELinux Policy Editor Control Panel}\label{fig:controlpanel}
\includegraphics*{images/controlpanel.png}
\end{figure}

By double-clicking icon, management windows  open. 
What you can do by double-clicking icons is summarized in following.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Status\\
       The usage is shown in section \ref{sec:seedit-status}.
       \begin{itemize}
	\item See status of SELinux, such as SELinux mode, domains for
	      running  process, domains for network process.
	\item Change SELinux mode
       \end{itemize}
 \item Manage Domain
       \begin{itemize}
	\item Create new domain(section \ref{sec:createdomainGUI})
	\item Remove domain, disable domain(section \ref{sec:unconfine:gui})
       \end{itemize}
 \item Generate Policy(section \ref{sec:addpolicy})
       \begin{itemize}
	\item Generate policy from access log
       \end{itemize}
 \item Edit policy(section \ref{sec:guieditor})
       \begin{itemize}
	\item Edit policy by text editor. The text editor has some
	      useful features.
       \end{itemize}
 \item Apply policy,Relabel
       \begin{itemize}
	\item Load policy manually\\
	      Policy is load automatically in GUI, but you can do it manually.
	\item Initialize all file labels\\
	\item Run restorecon command\\
       \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{See what's happening on your system}
After install, you have to see what's happening(status of SELinux) on your system.

\subsection{Where is policy?}
Simplified policy(policy described by SPDL) is located at
/etc/seedit/policy, it is explained in later section.
Simplified Policy is converted into SELinux
policy by seedit-load command(inside the command, seedit-converter runs,
it does main task), and SELinux Policy(binary SELinux policy,file\_contexts is generated).
 Generated SELinux policy is located at
/etc/selinux/seedit/policy, generated file\_contexts is at /etc/selinux/seedit/contexts/files.
Usually, you do not have to care  about generated policy.
\subsection{Default policy}
Installed simplified policy is a targeted one. Not strict policy.
It does not include RBAC support. Only selected daemons are protected.
Simplified policy can support RBAC and more strict policy, but such
policies are under construction :-) .About RBAC, it is ready to use, if
you are interested in it, see RBAC guide.

\subsection{Check status of SELinux(GUI)}\label{sec:seedit-status}
To check status of SELinux, select {\it Status} from control panel, then
window named{\it seedit Status} opens.

\subsubsection{Check/Switch enforcing/permissive mode}\label{sec:mode}
From {\it SELinux} tab, you can check/change mode of SELinux.
Figure \ref{fig:status-selinux} is screenshot.

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Check/change SELinux mode}\label{fig:status-selinux}
\includegraphics{images/status-selinux.png}
\end{figure}

By {\it seedit Installed? Yes}, you can know seedit is successfully
installed.
From {\it Current mode}, you can see current mode is permissive mode.
You can change current mode from this box, select {\it Enforcing} and
press {\it Apply} button.\\
{\it Mode at boot} is mode at system boot, if it is {\it Permissive},
after reboot, system will run as permissive mode.   It is strongly
recommended to configure as Enforcing when you use real system.

\subsubsection{See running process}
Some processes are given domain and behavior is confined.

From process$\rightarrow$Working Process, you can see domain of running
process.
Fig \ref{fig:status-working} is example output.

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Check domain of running processes}\label{fig:status-working}
\includegraphics*{images/status-working.png}
\end{figure}
You can see such process as bash is unconfined,  and httpd is  confined
by httpd\_t domain.

You can also sort  result by selecting PID, Process, Domain.
And by {\it Refresh} button, result is updated.


\subsubsection{See network process}
You can see status of network process(that is waiting network
connection) from   process$\rightarrow$Network Process
It is important to know status of network process. Because attackers use
network process to intrude. 

Fig \ref{fig:status-network} is example output.
\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Check domain of network processes}\label{fig:status-network}
\includegraphics*{images/status-network.png}
\end{figure}
From above, You have to be especially careful to service whose domain
is  unconfined.
If you create domain, you can confine it, or you may decide not to run
the service.


\subsection{seedit-unconfined(Command)}
You can also do the same task from seedit-unconfined command.

\subsubsection{See running process}
You can see status of processes by seedit-unconfined -e.
You have to be root to obtain correct result.
Following is example output.
\begin{verbatim}
$ su -
# seedit-unconfined -e
Current SELinux mode: permissive ----(1)
PID     Comm    Domain
1       init    Unconfined(init_t) ---(2)
...
1853    sshd    Confined by sshd_t ---(3)
\end{verbatim}
(1) is current SELinux mode this says permissive mode. Note again that system
    is not actually protected by SELinux in permissive mode.(2) says
    process init is not unconfined, and given unconfined domain
    init\_t. {\it unconfined} means: the given domain is allowed
    everything, and effectively not protected by SELinux. (3) says sshd
    is given sshd\_t domain and sshd\_t domain is configured to confine
    behavior of sshd.\\
You can also see domains by ps -eZ command, but it does not tell us what
    kind of domains are
    unconfined. /etc/selinux/seedit/policy/unconfined\_domains will tell
    you what kind domains are unconfined.

\subsubsection{See network process}
You can see status of network process(that is waiting network
connection), by seedit-unconfined -n. 
It is important to know status of network process. Because attackers use
network process to intrude. 
Sample output is following.
\begin{verbatim}
#seedit-unconfined -n 
Current SELinux mode: permissive ----(1)
/usr/sbin/smbd  Unconfined(initrc_t) -- (2)
/usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail     Confined by sendmail_t --(3)
...	
\end{verbatim}
It is like AppArmor's unconfined command. 
(1) is current SELinux mode. After network programs are shown.
(2) says smbd is not confined. (3) says
sendmail is confined by domain sendmail\_t.

\subsubsection{Switching enforcing/permissive mode}\label{sec:mode:command}
After install system is permissive mode. you can switch to enforcing
mode by following commands.
\begin{verbatim}
# setenforce 1
# getenforce 
enforcing
\end{verbatim}
If you want to be enforcing mode in boot time, you have to modify
 /etc/selinux/config like following. It is strongly recommended when you
 use real system.
\begin{verbatim}
SELinux=permissive
-->
SELINUX=enforcing
\end{verbatim}

\section{Then, what should we do?}
Now you know SELinux status of your system(what's
confined,unconfined). What you have to do after that can be summarized like below. 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Unconfine applications\\
   If you find application does not run due to SELinux access denial,
       you can choose unconfine such application.It's easy. You can see how to in
       section \ref{sec:unconfine}.
 \item Modify policy\\
       If you find application does not run due to SELinux access
       denial, but still want to confine application, you can modify
       policy.  See section \ref{sec:addpolicy}.
 \item Confine more applications by creating domains\\
       If you want to confine unconfined applications, you can prepare
       domain for them. See section \ref{sec:createdomainGUI}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Unconfine applications}\label{sec:unconfine}
You can unconfine application by 2 ways. Use boolean or remove config file.
\subsection{GUI}\label{sec:unconfine:gui}
You can do it from GUI. Select {\it Manage Domain}, then {\it seedit
Domain/Role Manager} window opens. Select {\it Delete Domain} tab.

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Unconfine application}\label{fig:manage-delete}
\includegraphics*{images/manage-delete.png}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Temporally disable}
The easiest way to unconfine application is to disable domain temporally.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Select domain which you want to disable
 \item Select radio button {\it Temporally}
 \item Press  Apply button
\end{enumerate}
For example, Apache is confined by httpd\_t domain  and you want to
unconfine Apache. Select httpd\_t, and press apply button.
Restart Apache and check domain by {\it Status} GUI, you will see {\it
Unconfined(initrc\_t)} is shown in domain.\\
To confine it again, select domain from {\it Enable temporally disabled
domain}, and press  {\it Apply} button.\\
This behavior is using boolean of SELinux, you can see detail by command
line.\\


\subsubsection{Remove domain}
Another way to unconfine application is to remove configuration file for
domain. The procedure is following.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Select domain which you want to disable
 \item Select radio button {\it Permanently}
 \item Press  Apply button
\end{enumerate}
To  confine application again,  you have to do it by hand.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item cd /etc/seedit/policy
 \item mv /etc/seedit/policy/extras/{\it name of domain}.sp
       /etc/seedit/policy/{\it name of domain}.sp
 \item seedit-load
\end{enumerate}
File size of generated policy will be smaller than previous method.

\subsection{Command line}
You can  also do it from command line.
\subsubsection{Use boolean}
If you know SELinux boolean, it's very easy.
For example, confined domain name is httpd\_t, then turn on
httpd\_disable\_trans boolean and restart daemon.
\begin{verbatim}
Example: 
# setsebool -P httpd_disable_trans 1
# /etc/init.d/httpd restart
# seedit-unconfined -e
Current SELinux mode: enforcing
PID     Comm    Domain
1111     httpd    Unconfined(initrc_t)
\end{verbatim}
You can confine again by turning off boolean
\begin{verbatim}
Example: 
# setsebool -P httpd_disable_trans 0
# /etc/init.d/httpd restart
# seedit-unconfined -e
Current SELinux mode: enforcing
PID     Comm    Domain
1111     httpd   Confined by httpd_t domain
\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{Remove config file}
Config file of domain is located
/etc/seedit/policy/{\it domain name}.sp.
If you remove it and restart application, you can unconfine application.
See example below.
\begin{verbatim}
Example: 
# cd /etc/seedit/policy
# mkdir unused
# mv httpd_t.sp unused
# seedit-load
# /etc/init.d/httpd restart
# seedit-unconfined -e
Current SELinux mode: enforcing
PID     Comm    Domain
1111     httpd    Unconfined(initrc_t)
\end{verbatim}
If you want confine again, place config file to /etc/seedit/policy dir.
\begin{verbatim}
Example: 
# cd /etc/seedit/policy
# mv unused/httpd_t.sp .
# seedit-load
# /etc/init.d/httpd restart
# seedit-unconfined -e
...
\end{verbatim}
\section{Simplified Policy basics}\label{sec:policy}
\subsection{Where is simplified policy?}
Our simplified policy is located at /etc/seedit/policy
directory. In the directory, files named {\it domain name}.sp are
located. 
\subsection{Policy syntax overview}
Simplified policy is described in syntax called Simplified Policy Description
Language(SPDL). For detail, see other document(SPDL specification).
You do not have to understand its full specification, because there is a
helper tool when you describe policy. But it is better for you to be
able to understand policy. \\
 Let's see overview of SPDL by looking at example.
Figure \ref{policyexample} shows policy for Apache web server.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Typical example of policy: Policy for Apache Web server}\label{policyexample}
\begin{verbatim}
     1  {
     2  domain httpd_t;
     3  program /usr/sbin/httpd;
     4  include common-relaxed.sp;
     5  include daemon.sp;
     6  include nameservice.sp;
     7  allow /var/www/** r,s;
     8  allow /var/log/httpd/** r,a,s;
     9  allow /etc s;
    ...<snip>..
    10  allownet -protocol tcp -port 80,443 server;
    11  allowpriv netlink;
    12  }	
\end{verbatim}
\end{figure} 

\subsubsection{Give domain to application}
Line 2 and 3 is configuration that gives domain to application .
Line 2 names domain as httpd\_t. Access rights for the domain is
configured. By default domain has {\it no} access rights, by configuring to
allow access to resources, domains can access resources.\\

line 3 means we will give httpd\_t
domain to /usr/sbin/httpd. By them, when /usr/sbin/httpd is executed, it
is confined by httpd\_t domain.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Note to experts\\
       To give domain we are using SELinux's domain transition
       mechanism. By line 2 and 3, domain transition from unconfined
       domain(such as initrc\_t) to httpd\_t, and entry point is
       /usr/sbin/httpd(which is labeled automatically by SPDL
       compiler).  So you have to notice that domain transition does
       not happen from confined domain.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Import typical configuration}
By line 4,5,6 configurations common to applications are imported.
To see what is imported, see files in include directory.
For example, {\it include include nameservice.sp;}, configuration that
is described in include/nameservice.sp is imported. Read access to files such
as /etc/hosts are allowed.

\subsubsection{Allow access to file}
Line 7-10 allows access to files. File name and permissions are described.
For filename, you can use grab like below. 
\begin{verbatim}
directory/* : means files under directory, not include subdirectory.
directory/**: means files under directory, including files under
		subdirectory.
\end{verbatim}
File name that starts with  \textasciitilde ~ represents
home directory(Not including /root).
\begin{verbatim}
~/public_html/**
\end{verbatim}
means public\_html directories under each user's home directories(except
/root).


You can specify following permissions.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Basic permissions
       \begin{itemize}
	\item s\\
	      Search.Permission to search file tree.i.e. Read file name list
	      in directory. For file, it means nothing.
	      
	\item  r\\
	      Read files.
	\item x\\
	      Execute files.
	\item  w\\
	      Write. This includes write,append,create,delete files.
       \end{itemize}
 \item Detailed permissions\\
       w permission is allowing too much, if you want more security, 
       w permission can be splitted into 5.
       \begin{itemize}
	\item a\\
	      Append.
	\item o\\
	      Overwrite. This means, write open file.
	\item c\\
	      Create. Create files.
	\item e\\
	      Erase. Delete files.
	\item t\\
	      Setattr.Modify file attribute(not including file security attribute).
       \end{itemize}       
\end{itemize}
Now you can understand line 7-9.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Line7: http\_t can see file lists and read all files under
       /var/www, including sub-directories.
 \item Line 8:
       http\_t can see file lists, read/append all files under
       /var/log/httpd, including sub-directories.
 \item Line 9:
       httpd\_t can see file list in /etc. Can not do anything files
       in /etc directory. Because /etc/* is not described.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Allow access to network}
Access to network can be described by simplified policy.
By line 10, httpd\_t is allowed to behave as a server using tcp 80,443 port.\\
If you want to allow httpd\_t to connect MySQL(TCP 3306), you have to
specify following.\\
allownet -protocol tcp -port 3306 client;\\
You can use -1023, 1024-, and * for port number. -1023 means all
wellknown ports(excepts ports used by other domains). 1024- means all
ports(except ports used by other domains) over 1024, and * means all port number.


\subsubsection{Allow other privilege}
Other important operations not related to files and networks are restricted by
SELinux. You can use {\it allowpriv name\_of\_privilege;}.
For example, usage of netlink socket(it is used to communicate with
kernel) is allowed in line 11.

\subsection{GUI Editor}\label{sec:guieditor}
By selecting {\it Edit Policy} from control panel, you can launch policy Editor.
From {\it Open} icon, you can select domain.
For example, when you open httpd\_t domain, you can see like figure \ref{fig:edit}.
You can  edit policy like text editor.\\
By {\it Save} button, you can save it and apply edited policy, policy
load is automatically done.\\
{\it Reload }  button read configuration file for domain  again, it is
useful when you edit policy from another tool(such as generator).\\
By {\it Add} button, you can insert policy at the end of file from GUI selection window.
You can see window like Figure \ref{fig:edit-file} and  \ref{fig:edit-network}.
From file tab, you can insert configuration related to file,  in  the
example of e Figure \ref{fig:edit-file}, after pressing  {\it Add},
\begin{verbatim}
allow /var/www/** r,s;
\end{verbatim}
will be inserted.
From network tab, you can insert configuration related to file,  in  the
example of e Figure \ref{fig:edit-network}, after pressing  {\it Add},
\begin{verbatim}
allownet -protocol tcp -port 80 server;
\end{verbatim}
will be inserted.

\section{Add policy by policy generation tool}\label{sec:addpolicy}
\subsection{Test in permissive mode}
If you find confined application run due to SELinux denial, you have to
add policy. \\
Before trying to add policy, test in permissive mode.
If application run in permissive mode, it is highly possible that SELinux is denying some access. You
have to add policy. We have GUI and command line utility.


\subsection{How policy generator works?}
Policy is generated from SELinux access log.
In test in permissive mode, access log is obtained.
In permissive mode, if access is denied by policy, it only takes log. To
make application work, you have to allow denied access. \\

Following is example of access denial log in audit.log. By this example,
how policy generator generates policy is shown.
\begin{verbatim}
----
time->Wed Apr 26 18:34:32 2006
1: type=PATH msg=audit(1146090872.442:29): item=0 
name="/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf" flags=101  inode=584775 dev=03:03

3: type=AVC msg=audit(1146090872.442:29): avc:  denied  { read }

ino=584775 scontext=user_u:system_r:ftpd_t 
tcontext=system_u:object_r:default_t tclass=file
----	
\end{verbatim}
Line 3 means, {\it read access by ftpd\_t domain to filename vsftpd.conf is denied}.
From line 3,  we can say that following should be added.\\\
\begin{verbatim}
allow vsftpd.conf r;
\end{verbatim}

However, full path for vsftpd.conf is not known. To obtain full path we
use log in line 1. It says full path for vsftpd.conf is
/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.
By combining line 1 and 3 we can conclude that following should be
added.
\begin{verbatim}
allow /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf r;	
\end{verbatim}
If you are not running auditd service log in line 1 is not obtained. In
other words, full path information is not included in log. That is why
we recommend to run auditd in using SELinux Policy Editor.\\
When  auditd is not running policy generator tries to obtain full path
by locate command, but it often fails.


\subsection{GUI(policy generator)}\label{sec:addpolicy}

\subsubsection{Launch tool}

Select {\it Generate Policy} from control panel, window like  figure
\ref{fig:vsftpd-generate-1} will open.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Policy Generate tool}\label{fig:vsftpd-generate-1}
\includegraphics*{images/vsftpd-generate.png}
\end{figure}
Usually, you do not have to configure nothing.
Press {\it Generate policy } button.


What can be configured is shown below for reference.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Input\\
       This is input source of SELinux access log. If auditd service is
       running, choose audit.log. auditd service is not running choose
       dmesg. 
 \item Generate more secure policy\\
       If checked, generator trys to generate more secure policy. In
       current version, it trys to use detailed file write
       permission(a,o,c,e,t). If not checked, those permissions are not
       used, instead w permission is used in generated policy.
 \item Read All log\\ 
  When checked, read all message from log input. If not input is read
       only from last policy load(the place where load\_policy
       permission is granted).
 \item Skip search log\\
       When checked, access denial for dir:search permission is
       skipped. dir:search  often lead to unwanted output.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Examine result and add policy}

After pressing {\it Generate policy } button,  policy is generated.
It takes  some time. When finished, result is outputted in Result tab.
Figure \ref{fig:vsftpd-generate-result-1} is example output.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Policy Generate result}\label{fig:vsftpd-generate-result-1}
\includegraphics*{images/vsftpd-generate-result.png}
\end{figure}

First row is asking, do you want to add {\it allownet -protocol tcp -port
1024- server;} to vsftpd\_t domain? And Log is access denial of SELinux,
from that log policy is generated.
If you want to  add policy, check check box.\\
{\it Glob} button is very useful.You can allow access to all files in directories.
For example, select row {\it allow /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf r,s;}
After clicking {\it Glob} button, the filename changes  like below.
\begin{verbatim}
/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf ->
/etc/vsftpd/* ->
/etc/vsftpd/** ->
/etc/* ->
/etc/** ->
/* ->
/** ->
\end{verbatim}
By {\it Undo Glob}, filename get back to previous one.\\
Policy that is going to be added is displayed in {\it Following will
be saved}, like figure \ref{fig:vsftpd-generate-save-1}.
If it looks good, press {\it Save and Apply} button.
The policy is added to domain, and policy is loaded to kernel.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Before save}\label{fig:vsftpd-generate-save-1}
\includegraphics*{images/vsftpd-generate-save.png}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Command line(audit2spdl)}
You can add policy by audit2spdl command. The usage is easy.
When auditd is running
\begin{verbatim}
# audit2spdl -al
\end{verbatim}
When auditd is not running,
\begin{verbatim}
# audit2spdl -dl
\end{verbatim}

You can read log by specifying filename, 
\begin{verbatim}
# audit2spdl -l -i /var/log/messages 
\end{verbatim}
This command translate SELinux log denial to simplified policy.
It is recommended to use auditd service if it is prepared for your
distro. For Fedora Core 5, you can install auditd by following commands.
\begin{verbatim}
#yum install audit
#chkconfig auditd on
#/etc/init.d/auditd start
\end{verbatim}


Following is sample output.
\begin{verbatim}
#audit2spdl -dl
.... It takes some time...
-------------------------
#SELinux deny log:
audit(1146162965.963:16): avc:  denied  { read } for  pid=6653 
comm="vsftpd" name="vsftpd.conf" dev=hda3 ino=584775 
scontext=user_u:system_r:ftpd_t 
tcontext=system_u:object_r:default_t tclass=file
#Suggested configuration
File ftpd_t.sp:
allow /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf  r;
-------------------------
...
\end{verbatim}

Above says you have to add 
\begin{verbatim}
allow /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf  r;	
\end{verbatim}
to ftpd\_t.sp to resolve SELinux access denial.

To add generated policy, in above example, 
open /etc/seedit/policy/vsftpd.sp.
and add allow /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf  r;	
between ${}$, like below
\begin{verbatim}
{
domain vsftpd\_t
program /usr/sbin/program;
allow ....
<add here!!>

}
\end{verbatim}
After adding file, you have to notice it to SELinux kernel. Type seedit-load.
\begin{verbatim}
#seedit-load
seedit-load: Success
\end{verbatim}
You can see progress of seedit-load by -v option like below
\begin{verbatim}
# seedit-load -v
mkdir -p ./sepolicy;
m4 -s ./simplified_policy/*.sp >./simplified_policy/all.sp;
/usr/bin/seedit-converter -i ./simplified_policy/all.sp -o 
./sepolicy -b ./base_policy -I ./simplified_policy/include ;
.................

cp /etc/selinux/seedit/contexts/files/file_contexts.all 
/etc/selinux/seedit/contexts/files/file_contexts.all.old
seedit-load: Success	
\end{verbatim}
In above case, you can add 
\begin{verbatim}
allow /etc/vsftpd/* r;.	
\end{verbatim}
It is a little different from that suggested by audit2spdl.
Because system administrate knows /etc/vsftpd is vsftp's configuration
directory, so it is more effective to allow access whole /etc/vsftpd directory.

\subsubsection{Advanced topic:Notice about audit2spdl}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Not best security\\
audit2spdl not always suggest best solution.
You have to review suggested configuration carefully.
For example, audit2spdl does not generate detailed file
permission(o,a,c,e,t), but generate w. \\
To generate permission o,a,c,e,t, use s option, like audit2spdl -dls .


\item Fail to suggest\\
In special case, suggesting configuration fails, following message
       appear.
\begin{verbatim}
#Failed to generate, because failed to obtain fullpath.	
\end{verbatim} 
In SELinux log, full-path is not contained. To obtain full path audit2spdl
       is doing some works, but it sometimes fail. 
To obtain full-path in all cases, you have to use auditd.
auditd is not installed in Fedora Core 5.
You can use auditd like below.
\begin{verbatim}
#yum install audit
#chkconfig auditd on
#/etc/init.d/auditd start
\end{verbatim}
The use audit2spdl -al, and try again.
It is also faster than audit2spdl -dl.


\end{enumerate}


\section{Creating domain}\label{sec:createdomainGUI}
Let's see by example to create domain ftpd\_t for vsftpd, and confine behavior
of vsftpd. By following this example you'll be able to prepare domain
for other programs.
Generally, process of creating domain is following.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Create template\\
 \item Check domain\\
 \item Test run and add policy\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Create domain from GUI}
We will create vsftp\_t domain, and configure the domain to work as
Anonymous FTP server. 

\subsubsection{Create template}
By Domain manager GUI you can create template configuration.
From control panel, select {\it Manage Domain}.
Let's assign vsftpd vsftpd\_t domain. 

You can do it like  fig \ref{fig:template}.
First, specify name of executable file. Enter {\it /usr/sbin/vsftpd}.\\
Next, specify domain name. Enter {\it vsftpd\_t}.\\
There are some questions you have to answer. \\
Then  press {\it Create Template} button. You will see created
configuration is shown in {\it Created template}.\\


\begin{figure}
\caption{Create new domain}\label{fig:template}
\includegraphics*{images/template.png}
\end{figure}

If you know about application, you already know what kind of access
rights are necessary. You can add it now. If you do not know, do not
worry. You can generate policy later.\\
You will prepare anonymous FTP server,so read access to /var/ftp is
necessary. And you need access right to TCP 21 port to behave as FTP
server.\\
You can add configuration from GUI. Press {\it Add policy} button.
Figure \ref{fig:add-file}, you are configuring to allow read access
under /var/ftp.
Figure \ref{fig:add-network}, you are configuring to allow usage of tcp
port 21. By pressing {\it Add} button, configuration 
\begin{verbatim}
allow  /var/ftp/** r,s;
allownet -protocol tcp -port 21 server;
\end{verbatim}
is added.
After adding configuration, press {\it Save and Apply} button.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Insert file access control policy}\label{fig:add-file}
\includegraphics*{images/add-file.png}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
\caption{Insert network access control policy}\label{fig:add-network}
\includegraphics*{images/add-network.png}
\end{figure}

If you are installing target application from rpm package, you can save
time to create policy by {\it Generate more policy} button. By pressing
this button, some policy is generated using information in rpm package.
In this example case, following will be generated.
\begin{verbatim}
allow /etc/pam.d/vsftpd r,s;
allow /etc/vsftpd/** r,s;
allow /usr/sbin/vsftpd r,s;
allow /var/ftp/** r,s;
\end{verbatim}

%% chroot環境でのパス提示の注意

\subsubsection{Check domain}
Switch to permissive mode(you can do by setenforce 0 or status GUI).
Start vsftpd and make sure its domain is vsftpd\_t(You can do it by
status GUI)

\subsubsection{Test run and add policy}
Test run vsftpd in permissive mode.

Let's test ftp like following.
\begin{verbatim}
$ ftp localhost
Name (localhost:ynakam): Anonymous
Password: <anything is OK>
...
and do something..	
\end{verbatim}
And see log.
\begin{verbatim}
#auserch -m AVC
\end{verbatim}
Various accesses are denied. So you have to add policy that allows
denied access.
You can do it easily  by policy generation tool.
Select {\it Generate Policy} from control panel, window like  figure
\ref{fig:vsftpd-generate} will open. Usually, you do not have to change
configuration, if you want more secure configuration, check {\it
Generate more secure policy}, it will generate policy that uses detailed
write permission, but you will need more time to complete configuration.
To generate policy press {\it generate} button. Then result is  shown
like figure \ref{fig:vsftpd-generate-result}. 
If you want to add generated  policy, check check boxes, and if you want
to allow to directory, use Glob button.
In this case,  it is more efficient to allow access to /etc/vsftpd
directory, so click Glob button twice.\\
Filename  changes  /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf  $\rightarrow$ /etc/vsftpd/*
$\rightarrow$ /etc/vsftpd/**.\\
In this case, configuration like \ref{fig:vsftpd-generate-save} will be
saved. Click {\it Save and Apply} button.\\
Test vsftpd again and use Policy Generation tool again, if you see
nothing, then test in Enforcing mode. If it works, all done!. If not,
add configuration by Policy Generation tool until it works.


\begin{figure}
\caption{Policy Generate tool}\label{fig:vsftpd-generate}

\includegraphics*{images/vsftpd-generate-save.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Create domain from command line}

\subsubsection{Create template}
You can create template configuration by seedit-template command.
Usage is following.
\begin{verbatim}
seedit-template -d <domain> -e <path to application> -o <output>
\end{verbatim}
Following is output for us.
\begin{verbatim}
# seedit-template -d vsftpd_t -e /usr/sbin/vsftpd
{
domain ftpd_t;
program /usr/sbin/vsftpd;
include common-relaxed.sp;
include daemon.sp;
include nameservice.sp;
}
\end{verbatim}
Template configuration is generated. In this, domain is named, and given
to /usr/sbin/vsftpd. By {\it include }, access rights commonly used for
daemons are imported.
You have to save this configuration under
/etc/seedit/policy/ftpd\_t.sp.
Note that file name must be {\it domain-name}.sp, otherwise seedit-load
fails. \\
Save above configuration to /etc/seedit/policy/ftpd\_t.sp.\\


\subsubsection{Check domain}
Load simplified policy by following.
\begin{verbatim}
#seedit-load
\end{verbatim}
And switch to permissive mode, because vsftpd will fail to work in
enforcing mode due to SELinux access denial.
\begin{verbatim}
#setenforce 0
#getenforce
Permissive
\end{verbatim}
Start vsftpd and check domain of vsftpd by seedit-unconfined.
\begin{verbatim}
# /etc/init.d/vsftpd restart
# seedit-unconfined -e
10530   vsftpd  Confined by ftpd_t
\end{verbatim}
You will see vsftpd is running as ftpd\_t as above.

\subsubsection{Test run and add policy}
Let's  run application in permissive mode, and find out what access is
denied, and allow such access by audit2spdl.
In this article, we aim to develop policy for vsftpd to work as
Anonymous FTP server.
Let's test ftp like following.
\begin{verbatim}
$ ftp localhost
Name (localhost:ynakam): Anonymous
Password: <anything is OK>
...
and do something..
\end{verbatim}
And see log.
\begin{verbatim}
#dmesg	
\end{verbatim}
Various accesses are denied.
Let's audit2spdl.

\begin{verbatim}
#audit2spdl -dl
-------------------------
#SELinux deny log:
audit(1146179470.043:86): avc:  denied  { search } for  
pid=10904 comm="vsftpd" name="vsftpd" dev=hda3 ino=584772 
scontext=user_u:system_r:ftpd_t 
tcontext=system_u:object_r:etc_t tclass=dir
#Suggested configuration
File ftpd_t.sp:
allow /etc/vsftpd  s;
-------------------------

-------------------------
#SELinux deny log:
audit(1146179477.891:108): avc:  denied  { search } for  
pid=10911 comm="vsftpd" name="ftp" dev=hda3 ino=163477
 scontext=user_u:system_r:ftpd_t 
tcontext=system_u:object_r:var_t tclass=dir
#Suggested configuration
File ftpd_t.sp:
allow /var/ftp  s;
-------------------------
.....
\end{verbatim}
audit2spdl tells us various configuration should be added.
You might find following. 
\begin{verbatim}
-------------------------
#SELinux deny log:
type=AVC msg=audit(1148486754.718:36): avc:  denied  { lock } for  
pid=11763 comm="vsftpd" name="test.txt" dev=hda3 ino=163311 
scontext=user_u:system_r:ftpd_t tcontext=system_u:object_r:default_t
 tclass=file
#Suggested configuration
File ftpd_t.sp:
#Failed to generate, because failed to obtain fullpath.
#allow test.txt  r,s;
-------------------------
\end{verbatim}
It means failed to suggest configuration because audit2spdl failed to
guess fullpath for test.txt.
But you know fullpath of test.txt is /var/ftp/pub/test.txt.
So, you will add allow /var/ftp/pub/test.txt r,s;
\\

In my case, following are suggested at first test.
\begin{verbatim}
allow /etc/vsftpd  s;
allow /var/ftp  s;
allow /root  s;
allownet -protocol tcp -port 21 server;
allowpriv cap_sys_chroot;
allow /var/log/xferlog  r,w;
allow /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf  r;
allow /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf  s;	
\end{verbatim}
You can add them, but you will notice it is more effective 
To allow r,s to /var/ftp and /etc/vsftpd.
So, your ftpd\_t.sp will be following.
\begin{verbatim}
{
domain ftpd_t;
program /usr/sbin/vsftpd;
include common-relaxed.sp;
include daemon.sp;
include nameservice.sp;
# added by audit2spdl suggestion
allow /etc/vsftpd/**  r,s;
allow /var/ftp/**  r,s;
allow /var/log/xferlog  r,w;
allow /root  s;
allownet -protocol tcp -port 21 server;
allowpriv cap_sys_chroot;
}
\end{verbatim}
After seedit-load, test vsftpd again.
You will find access denial again.
By audit2spdl you will find like following.
\begin{verbatim}
allownet -protocol tcp -port 6353 server;	
\end{verbatim}
This says ftpd is trying to behave server using 6553 tcp.
But the port number varies time to time.So it seems ftpd requires to use all port over 1024.
You can add following.
\begin{verbatim}
allownet -protocol tcp -port 1024- server;	
\end{verbatim}
Then, test again and add policy until no access denial is outputted.
At last, switch to enforcing mode.
\begin{verbatim}
#setenforce 1
\end{verbatim}
Test vsftpd again.  \\
%%%enforcingモードでテスト

\\
SPDL has advanced feature to configure more secure policy. 
For example, login user is not confined by default, 
to enhance login user security, you can use RBAC feature. 
About RBAC see RBAC guide.

\section{Other notices}
\begin{itemize}
       
 \item Notice about file move\\
       When you move file to another directory by mv command, you have to use restorecon
       command. Like below.
\begin{verbatim}
* Example: Upload homepage
# pwd
/root/homepage/index.html
# mv index.html /var/www/html
# restorecon -R /var/www/html	
\end{verbatim}
       If you forget last restorecon command, Apache will not be able to
       access /var/www/html/index.html, even if allow /var/www/** is
       described for httpd\_t.sp.
This is because, access right is inherited from source file in mv command. 
In this example, httpd\_t domain can not access under /root, but can
       read under /var/www.     After mv command, access rights to
       /var/www/html/index.html is the same as
       /root/homepage/index.html.
       To fix this situation you have to use restorecon command.\\
       GUI policy generator sometimes suggests restorecon.
 \item File creation\\
       Newly created file inherits access rights from directory. See
       example below.\\
Assume following configuration exists.
       \begin{verbatim}
domain foo_t;
allow /foo/bar/** r,s;
allow /foo/bar/test.txt r,w,s;
       \end{verbatim}
foo\_t can read files under /foo/bar, and write /foo/bar/test.txt.
If /foo/bar/test.txt does not exist at the time of configuration, 
and after configuration /foo/bar/test.txt is created, foo\_t can {\it
       read} test.txt, because newly created test.txt inherits allow
       /foo/bar/**. This is confusing, but limitation of our
       implementation.\\
To fix this, you have to do 
\begin{verbatim}
restorecon -R /foo/bar	
\end{verbatim}
Then foo\_t can read/write test.txt.\\
 \item Why restorecon is necessary?\\
       SELinux internally identifies resources by label called {\it
       type}.
       When mv command, label is preserved.When file is newly created,
       type is inherited from belonging directory.
       We have to fix relationship between file and type by restorecon command.

 \item cron jobs\\
       Cron jobs are not confined. If you want to protect cron job,
       edit system\_crond\_t.sp, delete {\it allowpriv all;}. However,
       configuring cron jobs correctly will be very difficult.
       
 \item Dynamically created/deleted files\\
       For files that are dynamically created/deleted, access control
       sometimes do not work well.
       See example below.
\begin{verbatim}
domain foo_t;
allow /foo/bar/** r,s;
allow /foo/bar/test.txt r,w,s;
\end{verbatim}
In this, if test.txt is deleted, and created, test.txt inherits access
       right of directory.
So, foo\_t can read test.txt but can not write test.txt.
You can fix by restorecon, but when it is re-created, you have to do
       restorecon again..\\
Therefore, for files whose access right is different from directory, and they
       are deleted/created, access control does not work well.
To resolve this, you have following solutions.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Give up controlling access for individual files\\
       you can write\\
allow /foo/var/** r,s,{\it w}.
By configuring above, if test.txt is deleted and created, foo\_t can
       write test.txt, however foo\_t can write other files under
       /foo/bar directory.
 \item Use allowtmp\\
       To protect such temporally files, SPDL supports allowtmp
       statement.
You can configure like following.
\begin{verbatim}
       allowtmp /foo/bar -name auto  r,w,s;	
\end{verbatim}
       By allowtmp statement, file can be identified by label in SPDL.
       This allowtmp statement means, files created under /foo/bar is
       labeled as foo\_foo\_bar\_t(-name auto generates label name based
       on domain and directory name, foo\_t + /foo/bar = foo\_foo\_bar\_t).
       And foo\_t can read, write files that have foo\_foo\_bar\_t label.
       By above, when  test.txt is deleted and created again, test.txt
       is given label(foo\_foo\_bar\_t) and identified by label.
       In allowtmp, file type transition in SELinux is internally used.\\
       If you want to access test.txt from other domain, you have to
       specify label not filename, like below.
\begin{verbatim}
	allow foo_foo_bar_t r;
\end{verbatim}
       In default policy,allowtmp is used to control access to /etc/mtab and temporally
       files under /tmp, /var/tmp.
\end{enumerate}
 \item Device files other than /dev\\
       Devices have critical impact to security, so it is treated specially.
       In default policy, device is assumed to exist under /dev.
       If you write allow statement for devices other than /dev
       directory, you can not access it.
       If you want to access devices other than /dev, you have to write
       allowdev statement.
       If you want to read access devices in /var/chroot/dev/null, 
       you have to write following, before describing allow /var/chroot/dev/null.
       \begin{verbatim}
	allowdev -root /var/chroot/dev;	
       \end{verbatim}
 \item Symbolic link\\
       Configuration to file that contains symbolic link is ignored.
       For example, \\
       allow /etc/init.d/httpd r;\\
       is ignored(init.d is symbolic link to rc.d/init.d).
 \item Hardlink\\
       In Linux system, contents of file can be refereed by multiple name
       using hard link. Hardlink is rarely used recent distro, but you
       have to note about this if you want to preserve security.\\
       In SPDL, following rule exists about hard link.\\
       {\it If file has multiple hardlink, to access the file, you must
       specify originally existing file name. Other file names are ignored}\\
       For example, /etc/shadow and /var/chroot/etc/shadow is hardlinked,
       and /etc/shadow exists originally, to access contents of
       /etc/shadow, you have to use file name /etc/shadow. Configuration
       using /var/chroot/etc/shadow will be ignored. 
       If some domain(assume foo\_t ) want to read
       /var/chroot/etc/shadow, you have to configure {\it allow
       /etc/shadow r;}\\
       Next, there is a question, what is criteria of file name {\it
       originally} exist? Following is answer.\\
       In following, /etc/shadow and /var/shadow is assumed as
       hardlinked files.
       \begin{enumerate}
	\item If rule is described to one file name, the file name is treated as
	      original.\\
	      Ex: allow /etc/shadow r; is described in some domain, but
	      rules using filename /var/shadow is not described,
	      /etc/shadow is treated as original.
	\item If rules are described to multiple hardlinked file name, the
	      filename that name is the youngest is treated as
	      original\\
	      Ex: allow /etc/shadow r, and allow /var/shadow r; are
	      described in some domains, /etc/shadow is treated as
	      original, because /var/shadow $>$ /etc/shadow.
	\item If rules are not described for hardlinked files, the
	      directory names that hardlinks exist are compared. The
	      file whose directory  name is oldest  is original.\\
	      Ex: /etc/shadow, /var/shadow do not appear in any domain.
	      Then /var/shadow is treated as original. Because
	      /var $>$ /etc.
       \end{enumerate}
       If you are not sure which hardlink is {\it original}, you can
       use all names. It means, you can describe
\begin{verbatim}
allow /etc/shadow r;
allow /var/shadow r;
\end{verbatim}
1 of 2 will be ignored, and do no harm.
  
       Above treatment of hardlink is necessary to avoid a kind of {\it back door }
       of path name based configuration. Assume hard link to
       /etc/shadow is created by some trick under /var/www/html, without this
       behavior, Apache web server can access contents of /etc/shadow
       via /var/www/html/shadow. To protect this, we must limit way to access
       hard link to 1.\\
       http://securityblog.org/brindle/2006/04/19 is good reference.\\

\end{itemize}


\section{Tips}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Confining Web applications\\

By default, CGI will run as httpd\_t domain. httpd\_t domain is a domain
for Apache Web Server, but domain is inherited to child programs by default.
If you want to change domain for CGI, you have to use domain\_trans element.
You can give CGI programs individual domain.
If you place your CGI in /var/www/cgi-bin, and give it cgi\_t domain,
create cgi\_t.sp like below.
\begin{verbatim}
{
domain cgi_t;
domain_trans  httpd_t /var/www/cgi-bin/**;
include common-relaxed.sp;
##### allowxxx will be here...
}

\end{verbatim}

For PHP, you {\it can not } change domain from httpd\_t. It is because
		PHP is internally executed not using exec system
		call. SELinux can not give domain for such case, unless
		PHP is extended to use SELinux system call.
\item deny\\
You can register important files in black list by {\it deny} element.
Following is example.
\begin{verbatim}
{
domain foo_t;
deny /etc/shadow;
allow /etc/** r,s;
}
\end{verbatim}
In above, foo\_t is allowed to all files by allow /etc/**, but can not
access /etc/shadow.
To access /etc/shadow, you have to write {\it allow /etc/shadow}
explicitly.
Some deny elements are written by default in include/common-relaxed.xp
\end{enumerate}
