\section{Enable RBAC}
To enable RBAC, use following command.
\begin{verbatim}
# seedit-rbac on
(It takes some minutes)
# reboot
\end{verbatim}
By above commands, files necessary to configure RBAC is moved from
/etc/seedit/policy/extra to /etc/seedit/policy, and seedit-load is
run.Reboot is necessary because some domains become invalid, to fix this
you have to reboot.\\

To disable RBAC, use following.
\begin{verbatim}
# seedit-rbac off
# reboot
\end{verbatim}
