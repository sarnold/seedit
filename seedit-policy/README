* How to INSTALL from source code

1. Before install
install seedit-converter in  /usr/bin/converter

2. Install option
You have some install option.

(1) Distribution option
You can install target distribution by "DISTRO" value.
FC4, AX2, TL10S are possible.
FC4 is Fedora Core4, AX2 is Asianux 2(Miracle Linux4), TL10S is turbo Linux 10 Server.

(1) user install and developper's install.
* User install 
The syntax is only from simplified policy description language.
So easy to look, and understand, editable from GUI.

* Developpers install
Macros defined in ./src/macros/template_macros.te are used in policy.
And there are some "ifdef"s .
These enable you more powerful description of policy.

You can specify this option by "DEVELFLAG" value.
When 1, developer's install, 0 it is user install.

(3) strict or easy 
You can specify installed policy is strict or easy by TYPE value.
TYPE= easy or strict.
When "easy" there are no RBAC like targeted policy , when "strict" there are RBAC.

(4) Install place
You can specify install place by "SELINUXTYPE" value.
Policy is installed in /etc/selinux/$SELINUXTYPE
SELINUXTYPE=seedit is recommended for user install, 
SELINUXTYPE=seedit-devel is recommended for developer's install

3. Let's install

1)Become root and following.
# make install DISTRO=(your distro) DEVELFLAG=1or0 TYPE=(easy or strict) SELINUXTYPE=(install place)
# make postconfig SELINUXTYPE=(install place)
# reboot

You can also specify option for make by editing build.conf file.

2) When reboot ,relabel will run.
When you are using turbolinux 10server, login and 
fixfiles restore

3) Reboot again
